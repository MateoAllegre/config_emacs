_Speedcubing (wieder)_

Today, I will talk about speedcubing. My presentation during the first semester was already about a similar subject, but it was mostly about speedcubing as a discipline, with Events and world records. This time, I will be talking about the cube itself, more specifically, I will be talking about the technical innovations in the mechanism of the Rubik's Cube. I'll start by presenting the base mechanism of the Rubik's Cube, and then, I will list some innovations that happened throughout the years.

First, let's start with how a standard Rubik's Cube works. There's a plastic piece in the middle, called the core. It sort of looks like a six-branch star, connecting to each of the six sides of the cube. Then, six center pieces are screwed to the core. These pieces only have one color, and the way they are attached to the core means that looking at the center piece of a side tells you what color belongs on that side.

The way the center pieces are attached to the core is important: there's a spring in between the two pieces in order to allow for some flexibility. This flexibility is necessary for "Corner Cutting", which is what happens when you try to turn a side with another partially turned side. "Corner Cutting" is one of the most important differences between a dollar store cube and an actual speedcube. 

The next type of piece is the edge piece. It has two colors and goes between two center pieces. Finally, there's eight corner pieces, which go between three edge pieces.

Now that I explained how the mechanism of a Rubik's Cube works, I will start listing and describing some innovations that have made the cubes better.

The first one isn't actually a modification to the mechanism itself. Traditionally, a Rubik's Cube is made of black or white plastic, and the colors of the sides are actually stickers that are glued to the pieces. However, this method isn't perfect. When a cube is used a lot, the stickers get damaged over time, and your cube might end up looking like this. When this happens, you have the option to reapply a new set of stickers, but it's even more annoying that it might seem: the stickers never end up aligned and air bubbles get everywhere. So, this begs the question: why even have stickers at all? That's the idea behind stickerless cubes, where the actual plastic of the pieces is colored. This is really convenient, but when it was invented, it created a debate in the community, and stickerless cubes were even banned from official competitions for a few years! Why? Well, the answer is here. More specifically, here. Thanks to the plastic being colored instead of stickers, you can tell that the back of this piece is green, which wouldn't be possible on a stickered puzzle. Eventually, the World Cube Association decided that it wasn't a big deal, and so stickerless cubes are now allowed in competitions.

Now, I will talk about what is probably the biggest innovation in all of cubing: magnets. As you can see here, the most basic type of magnet goes in an edge piece and a corner piece. At the end of a turn, the magnets attract each other, which gives a nice magnetic snap. It also makes cubes way more stable and enjoyable to turn.

The next innovation is another type of magnet: Corner-to-core magnets. During a turn, standard magnets have no effect, because they are too far apart. However, in the center of the cube, the leg of the corners have barely moved relative to the core. That's because during a rotation, points closer to the center move less than points that are farther away. Therefore, putting magnets in these places will make the cube more stable, even during a turn. It also allows for some "black magic" where a side turns on its own, like you can see here.

A rule of cubing is that there's never too much magnets in a puzzle, so let's see yet another type of magnet. Everytime you turn a side, the screw and the spring between the core and the center pieces rub against each other. This metal-on-metal friction could be removed with more magnets! If you take two magnets that repel each other, they can act like a spring: the more you try to apply force to get them closer to each other, the more they push back against it. That's the idea behind MagLev (or Magnetic Levitation), which replaces all the springs with pairs of repelling magnets, in order to reduce friction and make the cube faster. It also has the added benefit of removing spring noise, since there are no more springs.
